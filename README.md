# dnd5e-spellbook
<b>A Spellbook tool for the D&amp;D 5ed.</b>

It's my API practice. I chose a .json file because I found it to be the best D&D 5e spell list I've found in the web.

As for styling I chose a skeleton.css framework and slightly modified it. It's still WiP.

<b>Plans:</b>
Creating your own Spellbook and adding spells to it.
